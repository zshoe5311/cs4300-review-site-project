The deliverable project summary, responsibility matrix, and diagrams will be found in the Music Madness Powerpoint. More info on how
to work the program can be found in the ShortUserGuide.docx

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Steps to start the project:

1. Take the 'Group6Project' zip file, and put it in your xampp/htdocs folder

2. Extract the zip file inside the htdocs folder (the result should be a single 'Group6Project' folder, containing all of the code
files and project-related folders)

3. Open the XAMPP control panel and start the Apache Web Server Module and the MySQL Module (make sure no other MySQL servers are 
runnning on the same port, or the website will not work).

4. Open your web browser (Chrome Recommended) and navigate to 'localhost/Group6Project' in the URL bar

It is not necessary to import any create table statements, the code creates the database on its own through the 'config.php' file in 
the config folder. The created database will be named 'reviewsitedata', and will have a 'albums', 'reviews', and 'users' table.

No starter code was used, the code for the .slide-in-fwd-center and .flip-in-hor-top css classes were generated by Animista at 
animista.net, but other than that all code originated from the members of our group (Group 6).

Functionalities for different types of users:

	- Logged out Users (Guests) should be able to: Search albums, view album pages, view other users' account pages, create an
	account, log in
	- Logged in Users should be able to: Do everything* logged out users can, create reviews, delete their own reviews, view their 
	own account page, log out
	- Admin Users should be able to: Do everything logged in users can, add albums**, delete albums, delete other user's reviews
	
	* logged in users cannot create an account like logged out users until they themselves log out, but it otherwise this 
	functionality is not restricted from them

	** in order for the image to display properly when adding an album, it is IMPERATIVE that the name of the image file you put in
	the albumArt input is already in the 'albArt' folder

You must be running xampp in order to run the website properly, and the files for the site must be placed
in your xampp htdocs folder. MySQL and Apache must be turned on within xampp.
