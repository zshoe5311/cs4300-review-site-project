Salad Days is the second full-length studio album by Canadian musician Mac DeMarco. It was released on April 1, 2014 through Captured Tracks. Following the debut releases of Rock and Roll Night Club and 2 in 2012 and the extensive touring for both releases in 2013, DeMarco worked on material for his next album at his Bedford-Stuyvesant apartment in Brooklyn. Salad Days garnered acclaim from critics, and debuted at number 30 on the Billboard 200. The album spawned two singles: "Passing Out Pieces" and "Brother". To promote the album, DeMarco went on a tour that spanned across North America, South America and Europe. DeMarco recorded Salad Days in his apartment, in the Bedfordâ€“Stuyvesant area of Brooklyn, New York,[2] following an extensive tour in support of his debut releases, Rock and Roll Night Club and 2, both of which were released in 2012. DeMarco noted that he felt "fuckin' bummed out", upon the tour's completion, stating: "I feel sort of weathered and beat down and grown up all of a sudden. I've always had some kind of plateau that I wanted to reach, and now I just can't see the next one."[3]. The album was recorded on a Fostex A-8, just like its predecessor, 2.[4]
