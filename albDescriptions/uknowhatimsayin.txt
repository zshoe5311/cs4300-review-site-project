On November 1, 2017, Danny Brown revealed he was working on a follow-up effort to Atrocity Exhibition, telling Complex that the album was "being produced by one producer, who's legendary in hip-hop. And it's gonna be a big deal".[1] Q-Tip, famous for being the main producer for New York hip hop group A Tribe Called Quest, revealed his involvement with Brown's album during a guest appearance on Elton John's Rocket Hour show on Beats 1 radio on March 21, 2019.[2] Brown initially began working with A Tribe Called Quest member Ali Shaheed Muhammad, before eventually working with Q-Tip instead.[3] Brown later explained that the album and its title, U Know What I'm Sayin?, doesn't have a concept; "Half the time, when black people say, 'You know what I'm sayin'', they're never saying nothing  ... This is just songs. You don't have to listen to it backwards. You don't have to mix it a certain way. You like it, or you don't".[4]
